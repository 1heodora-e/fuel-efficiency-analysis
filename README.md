# fuel-efficiency-analysis

This project is a short analysis of a fuel economy dataset. I looked at how fuel-efficient most vehicles are by creating a histogram of combined MPG and used a heatmap to explore how different features like engine size, emissions, and fuel scores relate to each other. The goal was to understand which factors impact fuel efficiency and which columns might be unnecessary due to strong correlations. Everything was done using Python and basic data visualization tools.
